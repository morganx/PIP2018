The raw data from which these data are generated is deposited as PRJNA345144.

Samples in this project were sequenced multiple times across multiple HiSeq lanes. Therefore, a single sample can be represented by as many as 24 fastq files.

To generate data for this publication, MetaPhlAn 2.0 was run on all fastq files for each sample according to default parameters, resulting in one set of relative abundances per sample. These results are contained in "taxonomy.tsv". 

modules.tsv and modules.pcl are identical except for being transposed. They were generated by running HUMAnN v 0.99 on the data according to default parameters. 

Pathways.tsv and pathways.pcl are identical except for being transposed. They were generated by running HUMAnN v 0.99 on the data according to default parameters.

The folder "derived data" contains versions of these files in which samples with >=1.5 IQR E. coli have been removed.
