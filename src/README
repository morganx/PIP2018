# In order to address the concerns of Reviewer #2, we have provided code for generation of two sets of results - our data filtered & not filtered to remove E. coli outliers.

Master.RMD - makes most figures in paper, filters data to remove 1.5 IQR E. coli outliers

Master-unfiltered.RMD - does same thing as Master.RMD, but does not filter data

Rarefaction_functions.r - accessories for making rarefaction curves

# Note: these are not quite identical because R & many libraries were upgraded between the time the first & second were run. Although this uses the versions of nlme & gam recommended by the software maintainers, p and q-values came out incorrect if do-maaslin-unfiltered was run with a random effects model for individual. This bug has been reported to the software maintainers but there is not a current fix.
 
do-maaslin.RMD - runs multivariate linear modeling (on filtered data)
do-maaslin-unfiltered.RMD - runs multivariate linear modeling on unfiltered data

# These two files update maaslin outputs with the annotation of KEGG modules
fix_maaslin_kegg.pl (usage: perl fix_maaslin_kegg.pl maaslin_output.txt > updated.txt)
 
kegg.txt : a reference of annotations of kegg modules & pathways

Monte Carlo analysis files:

Monte_carlo_power_test.R is a function that powers generation of monte carlo analysis figures.
Monte_carlo_pip_gitlab-FILTERED.RMD and Monte_carlo_pip_gitlab-UNFILTERED.RMD generate the Monte Carlo analysis figures for filtered & unfiltered data respectively.

Reviewer2.RMD : a few plots we  made to answer Reviewer #2's questions. Also contains code to generate supplemental fig 14.
